## What can you do with it?
* It's currently used in GAM100 in Redmond and Malaysia as a way for students to very quickly build prototype games and even do their first team game.
* R&D uses it for a whole curriculum series aimed at High School students.
* It could be used in other classes such as AI, Math, and Physics where course projects have students demonstrating cool enemy behaviors or dynamic body collisions and resolutions, but they wouldn't need to write a complete engine or know how to do graphics etc.
